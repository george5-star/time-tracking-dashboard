## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Every project comes with new challenges and again this challenge doesn't fail to provide one. I think I learned how to use local json file using the fetch api to make it a little interactive.

### Continued development

Again, the learning never stops which is awesome. Going forward, I will be sharpening my overall frontend skills, accessibility, animation etc.
